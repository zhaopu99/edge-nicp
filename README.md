# edge-nicp

This repository contains the source code for the paper **"Enhanced 3D Facial Registration via Edge-Constrained Non-rigid ICP and Global Spatial Similarity Evaluation"**. The proposed method introduces an edge-constrained Non-rigid ICP algorithm for 3D facial model registration.

## Installation

Please follow the installation steps listed in the [install.txt] file.

## Usage

### 01_demo_3dmm_fitting_scan.py
This script generates the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) template for facial models.

### 02_demo_edge_nicp.py
This script is used for generating the final registered 3D facial model.

### 03_demo_express.py
This script generates the 3DMM model template and final result for facial scans with expressions.

## Dependencies

- Basel Face Model: You will need to download the Basel Face Model from the official website.
